# API Endpoints (FastAPI)

All JSON; errors follow `{error: {code, message, hint?}}`. **Every route below `/api/` except `/api/auth/*` and `/api/meta/health` requires a valid JWT session; all resources are scoped to the authenticated user.** Mutating routes pass the credit/quota middleware first — quota failures return 429 with `{hint: "2 of 3 daily videos used", resets_at}`.
